# Rumour Varacity Prediction
Fact checking has been a popular research topic. The target of my research is to build a model to determine the veracity of rumors in social media. This is a task of International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation 2019, which is “Task 7: RumourEval 2019: Determining Rumour Veracity and Support for Rumours”.

The tasks are clearly defined by sponsors of this challenge, which include two subtasks: Task A, stance classification of the responses to a rumorous post; Task B, veracity prediction of the statements.
